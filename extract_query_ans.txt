CONTEXT: {CONTEXT}

Your task is:
1. Read the entire context carefully.
2. Extract ONLY the parts of the context that directly answer the query.
3. Do NOT skip any detail, even small lines, phrases, or hints.
4. Do NOT add your own interpretation or new information. Only extract.
5. Your output must be in the same language used in the context.
